Stock Analysis API's

I am currently working on this project where I am using the Angle one stock broker. With its help, I can analyze the recent performance of any stock and based on that, the API suggests whether I should buy that stock or not. I can create a wishlist of stocks and keep an eye on them. Whenever a stock falls within the buy range, this software will notify me that I can buy it. I have used multiple algorithms for stock prediction such as MACD, Moving Averages, Price action, ROC, RSI, VWAP, and Volume, which can provide me with buy signals.
